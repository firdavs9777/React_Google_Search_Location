# Location Search Application

This is a **React** application designed to search and display locations based on user input. The app integrates **Tailwind CSS** for styling and utilizes an API to fetch location data. It features a search bar, a list of places, and the ability to select a place for further interaction.

## Features

- **Search Locations**: A search bar allows users to search for locations based on a term entered in the input field.
- **List of Places**: Displays a list of places based on the search query. Each place is shown with a "Go" button that triggers a callback function when clicked.
- **Tailwind CSS**: The application uses Tailwind CSS for responsive and modern styling.
- **React Functionality**: The app uses React hooks (like `useState`) to manage state for places and search term dynamically.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe version of JavaScript used for static type checking.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Vite**: Next-generation build tool for faster development and builds.
